# EdgeExtensions
Extensions For MS Edge

Liquid Seperation - Not as cool as it sounds, it's just a customized version of the start page for Edge.
  - Lets you use a bookmarks folder to control what quick links / top sites appear on the front instead of the volatile topsites database.
  - Allows you to have up to 4 rows of top sites instead of the limited 1 row with Edge by default.
  - Based off of peapix.com's new tab page extension: https://peapix.com/peapix-new-tab-background
